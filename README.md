370 four-part chorales by Johann Sebastian Bach
===============================================

Four-part chorales collected after J.S. Bach's death by his son
C.P.E. Bach (and finished by Kirnberger, J.S. Bach's student, after
C.P.E. Bach's death). Ordered by Breitkopf & Härtel numbers.

The first complete edition of these chorales was published by Breitkopf &
Härtel between 1784&ndash;1787 in four volumes. The first incomplete
edition consisting of 200 chorales in two volumes was published by
Friedrich Wilhelm Birnstiel in 1765 & 1769, reprinted in 1975 by Georg
Olms.

This digital edition is referenced against the fourth edition of the
chorales by Breitkopf & Härtel, c. 1875: 371 vierstimmige Choralgesänge
von Johann Sebastian Bach. 4th ed. by Alfred Dörffel. Breitkopf &
Härtel, Leipzig [c. 1875]. 178 pp. Plate Number: V.A.10. Retypeset
c. 1915 as Edition Breitkopf 10. Reprinted by Associated Music Publishers,
Inc., New York [c. 1940].  A scan of the original edition can be viewed on
[IMSLP](https://imslp.org/wiki/371_Vierstimmige_Choralges%C3%A4nge_(Bach%2C_Johann_Sebastian)).

The source edition has 371 chorales, but chorale 150 is not a four-part
chorale, so it has been omitted from this analytic edition of the
chorales.  However the numbering of the chorales is maintained as in
the source edition, with file `chor150.krn` not being included in this
digital edition.
